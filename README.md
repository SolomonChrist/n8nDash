## üéØ Vision

Our goal is to help people live the greatest lives ever lived ‚Äî using AI + Automation. n8nDash makes this possible by providing an intuitive, touchscreen-ready interface for managing and triggering your n8n automations. It's made for AI + Automation professionals to help non-technical users by giving them a non-technical beautiful frontend UI to show them. This could be a business dashboard for a busy CEO or a social media dashboard for the local influencer or a data dashboard for the local manufacturing company that also needs to write blogs using AI. Whatever your vision, you can design it with the power of n8n under the hood and n8nDash in the frontend!

## üéØ WHY WAS THIS MADE?

Solomon Christ has been helping teach n8n to thousands of people around the world and many of the customers and clients in the United States and globally don't know what AI + Automation is. Infact many hear the words AI but don't really know how to apply it to their daily lives or businesses. Many just want a magic button that can do X OR a single location to easily view their data or a way that is non-technical to just get results. Many n8n + Automation users eventually end up building out a custom dashboard for their clients. The idea here was to build out something that the whole community across n8n + AI + Automation could use and build together that would allow non-technical users to be able to enjoy the results of many of our complex n8n workflows, without having to worry about going into an n8n backend or worse, changing the n8n workflow by mistake. As mass adoption eventually starts to take over with AI + Automation in the coming years, having an easy to use frontend dashboard for non-technical users becomes even more important!
